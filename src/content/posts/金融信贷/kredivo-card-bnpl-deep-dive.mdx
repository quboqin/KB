## 1. Virtual Card Products and Regulatory Issues

### 1.1 Flexi Card (Offline Physical BNPL Card Mechanism)

Kredivo's "Flexi Card" was a physical card that felt like a credit card to users, but was structurally built on a **debit card** framework. The card was issued by a partner bank using its debit card license. Whenever a user made a transaction, Kredivo would pre-fund a dedicated account to cover that transaction, allowing the user to draw on their Kredivo credit limit. From the user's perspective, it felt like paying with a credit card, but behind the scenes Kredivo was essentially funding the transaction through the banking system in debit card form.

### 1.2 Regulatory Non-Compliance (Flexi Card)

Flexi Card launched **without obtaining explicit prior regulatory approval** and was suspended in early 2024 due to regulatory concerns. OJK determined that the product did not meet requirements — specifically, the transaction funds should have flowed to the user's own bank account, not to a corporate account on Kredivo's side. Because the fund flow did not align with OJK/BI rules, Kredivo was required to shut down the Flexi Card project.

### 1.3 Similar Products in the Market

Other market participants have attempted similar "credit-card-like" products but faced comparable regulatory resistance. For example, Home Credit and Bank Jago (both of which hold credit card licenses) launched similar approaches. Kredivo was not the first mover, but products of this type generally **failed to achieve scale** because OJK intervened to block them.

### 1.4 Infinite Card (Virtual Credit Card)

Kredivo's "Infinite Card" was a virtual credit card launched in partnership with a bank and Mastercard. Unlike a typical co-branded credit card — where the bank issues the card and carries the loan on its balance sheet — the Infinite Card had its **credit limit and risk sitting on Kredivo's side**, even though the card carried the bank's branding.

### 1.5 Licensing Issues (Infinite Card)

Regulators determined that the Infinite Card model was **not permitted**, because Kredivo lacked the necessary licenses. OJK/BI communicated that offering a "credit-card-like" product requires:

1. A **Payment Service Provider (PJP/payment gateway) license**, and
2. Ultimately, a **credit card issuance license**.

Operating the Infinite Card relying solely on the partner bank's license was deemed unacceptable. Since Kredivo did not hold either license, the Infinite Card plan was halted. Importantly, the core issue was **licensing compliance**, not fund flow.

### 1.6 Future Card Product Plans

Kredivo is considering **relaunching** a card product in the future, contingent on meeting regulatory requirements. One pathway is to first obtain a PJP license (and ultimately a credit card issuance license) to launch a compliant virtual credit card. Discussions with regulators are **still ongoing**, and as of now there is no finalized resolution or approval.

### 1.7 Why Owning Krom Bank Does Not Solve the Problem

The fact that Kredivo owns a bank (Krom Bank) does not bypass the licensing requirements. Even as a bank, issuing a credit card requires a separate **credit card issuance license** — which Krom does not currently hold. In principle, both Krom Bank and Kredivo itself can apply for the PJP and credit card issuance licenses, but until those are obtained, neither entity can operate a credit card product.

### 1.8 Strategic Rationale for Launching a Kredivo Card

Kredivo views a card product as a channel to **significantly expand the use cases and acceptance footprint** of its credit. The current BNPL model requires merchant-by-merchant integration. With an open-loop card (physical or virtual), Kredivo users could spend at **any merchant that accepts card payments**, including a vast long-tail of merchants that would never be onboarded individually. In essence, the card serves as a distribution channel that unlocks coverage far beyond Kredivo's directly integrated merchant network.

### 1.9 Unified Credit Limit

A future Kredivo card would share the same credit limit as the main Kredivo app. Users would not receive a separate "card limit" — instead, they would draw from their existing Kredivo credit line across all channels: offline installments, online BNPL, and card transactions, all under a single unified limit.

## 2. QRIS Payment Channel Access

### 2.1 QRIS-Based BNPL Pilot

Kredivo attempted a pilot to allow its credit limit to be used for **offline payments via QRIS** (Indonesia's unified QR code payment network). This pilot was shut down by regulators because, under current rules, a BNPL credit limit is **not a recognized funding source for QRIS**. QRIS only permits bank account balances, e-wallet balances, credit cards, or other OJK-approved instruments as funding sources. Without an e-money license or credit card license to back the product, Kredivo could not continue offering QRIS-based payment capability.

### 2.2 Current Offline Payment Method

As a result, Kredivo's offline installments are currently limited to merchants that have **directly integrated** with Kredivo. For example, using Kredivo at Alfamart or other stores works through Kredivo's direct POS integration with those merchants — not through the universal QRIS network. Shopee PayLater similarly relies on direct merchant connections for offline use. By contrast, e-wallets like GoPay can be used universally at any QRIS terminal.

## 3. Interest Rate Caps and Fees

### 3.1 Rate and Fee Regulation

Indonesia has a monthly interest rate cap of approximately **1.75%** for traditional credit cards, but there is no explicitly stated regulatory cap on BNPL. Some institutions effectively exceed the 1.75% equivalent cost by adding various fees, because restrictions only apply to items classified as "interest" — additional charges classified as "fees" are not currently prohibited by specific regulatory language. However, if this practice becomes widespread or excessive, OJK/BI may introduce new rules to constrain it.

## 4. Business Performance and Financial Metrics

### 4.1 Monthly GMV

Kredivo's monthly GMV (loan disbursements) has recently exceeded **IDR 3.5 trillion** (~USD 215 million).

### 4.2 Product Mix

| Segment | Share of Monthly GMV |
|---|---|
| Cash loans | ~45% |
| BNPL | ~55% |

Within BNPL:

| Channel | Share |
|---|---|
| Online e-commerce | ~40% |
| Offline (in-store) | ~60% |

### 4.3 Key Channels

Key online channels include major e-commerce and digital service platforms:
- **Shopee** is one of the largest BNPL volume sources
- **Tokopedia** is also significant
- **TikTok Shop** is growing rapidly

Kredivo's **"biller" category** (mobile top-ups, gaming credits, utilities, etc.) also contributes substantial volume.

### 4.4 Platform Integration and Brand Visibility

On some platforms (e.g., certain Shopee transactions via indirect integration), Kredivo's brand may not be prominently displayed. These indirect transactions are not the core of the business — direct integrations and biller categories contribute more volume — but they have implications for brand visibility.

### 4.5 Profitability

Kredivo's Indonesia business has achieved **profitability**. Online BNPL, which was growing more aggressively before, has also recently turned EBITDA-positive. Not only is EBITDA positive, but **net profit after tax** is also positive.

### 4.6 Revenue and Margins

- Group-level **EBITDA margin**: approximately **12–15%**
- Monthly revenue has been **stable above USD 40 million** (consistently since late last year)

### 4.7 Unit Economics

At the individual transaction level, Kredivo is **unit-economics positive** across all product lines: online BNPL, offline BNPL, and cash loans all generate positive transaction-level profit. Average **transaction-level margin** (revenue minus cost of funds, credit cost, and transaction losses, excluding marketing and overhead) is approximately **20% of the outstanding loan book**.

### 4.8 Krom Bank Financials

Krom Bank is **consolidated** into Kredivo Group and is itself profitable. A significant portion of Krom's revenue comes from intra-group transactions with Kredivo (e.g., providing funding for Kredivo's loan disbursements). While regulators are relatively strict about intra-group transactions, owning an in-house bank **lowers Kredivo's cost of funds** and allows internalization of the interest spread, improving overall profitability.

### 4.9 Funding Sources

| Funding Source | Share |
|---|---|
| Krom Bank deposits | ~35–40% |
| External channels (banks and institutional funders) | ~60% |

Key external funding partners include Bank Mandiri, DBS, and Standard Chartered.

### 4.10 Merchant Discount Rate (MDR)

- For merchants **directly integrated** with Kredivo (including major offline chains): MDR is typically **~1.0–1.5%** (some up to ~2%), with T+1 settlement
- For transactions on Shopee/Tokopedia that are **not direct Kredivo checkout integrations**: Kredivo does **not** charge MDR to the platform

## 5. Market Position and Expansion

### 5.1 Offline BNPL Market Share

Kredivo has grown into **one of the leaders** in the offline installment market. As of 2025, internal estimates suggest its offline BNPL volume is at least comparable to — and may have surpassed — **Home Credit**, which had long been the dominant player. Shopee PayLater is also expanding offline, but its offline volume remains relatively smaller by comparison.

### 5.2 Merchant Network Growth

Kredivo has been aggressively expanding its merchant network **beyond Greater Jakarta** to broader regions, signing up local chain stores including regional mobile phone retailers. Non-national/regional retailers (such as local mobile phone chains and Alfamart-type general retail) are steadily joining, with their contribution to offline GMV increasing month by month. **Electronics retail** remains the largest offline category, while **services and general retail** are beginning to scale.

### 5.3 Regional Distribution

The regional mix is **roughly balanced**. Currently, transactions from **outside Greater Jakarta** account for slightly below 50%, while Greater Jakarta and other major cities account for slightly above 50%. A few years ago, the outside-Jakarta share exceeded 60%; as urban centers have ramped up, the mix has converged to roughly 50/50.
